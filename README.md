# Why hello! 👋 Nice to see you.

Dare I say... hello world?

My name's Tyler Bartle, and I'm a student at Brigham Young University—Idaho. I'm a senior, studying computer science. I've spent most of my time programming, and I love it! I would love to make a career out of it.

## About Me 🙋‍♂️

I love programming, but I'm also *fascinated* by machine learning! My [cse450](https://github.com/Tman7077/cse450) repository has some of my dabblings therewith—peep that for a glimpse!

Most of my time as an amateur programmer has been spent on smaller projects, and a lot of that has been focused on learning as many things as I can. Most of my experience is programming in various languages, but I have also spent time with data science & analytics, database engineering & management, full-stack development, and machine learning.

<h6>I'm even working on a game! (<i>soon</i>™)</h6>

## Technologies and Tools 👨‍💻

I have the most experience in Python and C#, as those have been my focuses, but I've also spent a fair amount of time with

- Elixir & Erlang,
- HTML & CSS,
- JavaScript, and
- SQL.

I've dipped my toes in quite a few colors of paint, so I also have limited experience with
- Unity,
- Go,
- Java,
- TypeScript, and
- C++.
